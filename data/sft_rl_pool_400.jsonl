{"input": "1. Solution. First, consider some fixed vertical order of laying the glasses (from bottom to top). It is clear that by rotating the entire layout by some angle, we will not change the layout (we will not get a new layout). Therefore, we can assume that the bottom glass in the layout is always fixed (does not rotate). Then the layouts (with a fixed vertical order of glasses) will differ from each other by the rotation of each of the subsequent four upper glasses by $0^{\\circ}, 90^{\\circ}, 180^{\\circ}$, and $270^{\\circ}$ relative to the fixed bottom glass. Therefore, we will get a total of $4^{4}=256$ layout options with a fixed vertical order of glasses. Adding now all possible vertical permutations of the five glasses ($5!=120$ options), we get the total number of possible glass layouts in a stack: $5!4^{4}=120 \\cdot 256=30720$ pieces. But not all these layouts meet the condition of the problem. The layouts that meet the condition of the problem are only those in which the entire stack turns out to be vertically opaque. Consider the columns of triangles located above each of the four fixed triangles of the bottom glass. The condition of the problem will be met when each of these four columns is opaque. One of these columns is already opaque by default (the one standing on the bottom shaded triangle). Consider the ordered set (vector) of possible angles of rotation (for definiteness, clockwise) of the shaded triangles on each of the 4 upper glasses relative to the bottom shaded triangle: $\\left(\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{2}, \\alpha_{3}, \\alpha_{4}\\right)$, where $\\alpha_{k} \\in\\left\\{0^{\\circ}, 90^{\\circ}, 180^{\\circ}, 270^{\\circ}\\right\\}, k=1,2,3,4$.\n\nAll \"columns\" of glass triangles will be opaque if in this set of rotation angles there is at least one angle $90^{\\circ}$, at least one angle $180^{\\circ}$, and at least one angle $270^{\\circ}$ (while the angle $0^{\\circ}$ does not have to appear, although it will not hurt if it does appear). To count the total number of such sets (and thus the number of layouts with a fixed vertical order of glasses), we will divide them into four groups:\n\n- sets in which all rotation angles are different, i.e., all $\\alpha_{k}$ are pairwise different; there are a total of $4!=24$ such sets (due to permutations);\n- sets in which the rotation angles $180^{\\circ}$ and $270^{\\circ}$ appear once each, and the rotation angle $90^{\\circ}$ appears twice; there are a total of $6 \\cdot 2=12$ such sets (here 6 is the number of positions in the vector for two angles of $90^{\\circ}$, and 2 is the two permutations of the angles $180^{\\circ}$ and $270^{\\circ}$ in the remaining two positions);\n- sets in which the rotation angles $90^{\\circ}$ and $270^{\\circ}$ appear once each, and the rotation angle $180^{\\circ}$ appears twice; similarly, there are a total of $6 \\cdot 2=12$ such sets (due to permutations);\n- sets in which the rotation angles $90^{\\circ}$ and $180^{\\circ}$ appear once each, and the rotation angle $270^{\\circ}$ appears twice; similarly, there are a total of $6 \\cdot 2=12$ such sets (due to permutations).\n\nIn the end, we get a total of $24+12+12+12=60$ ordered sets of rotation angles that meet the required condition. This is the total number of layouts with a fixed vertical order of glasses, in which the final stack turns out to be opaque. Finally, by permuting the glasses in $5!=120$ ways, we get the total number of $120 \\cdot 60=7200$ layouts in which the final stack turns out to be opaque.", "label": "7200"}

{"input": "James injured himself while exercising, pulling his hamstring which caused significant pain for 3 days. Based on his physiotherapist's advice, he realized that this type of injury would actually require at least 5 times as long to fully heal, and he needs to keep in mind that a setback or complication could further delay his recovery. To be cautious, he decided that he would wait another 3 days beyond the initial healing time before even considering light workouts.\n\nWhen he does get back into it, his physiotherapist wants him to start off with light exercises only for 2 weeks. There's a possibility that complications could arise in this stage, adding an additional week for recovery. If everything goes smoothly, James can then progress to moderate intensity workouts for another week.\n\nAssuming there are no further setbacks, his physiotherapist explained that he would need to wait 3 weeks after transitioning to moderate intensity workouts to start lifting heavy again. \n\nTaking into account the injury, recovery time, potential setbacks, and various workout intensities, how long could it potentially take before James can resume heavy lifting?", "label": "67"}
